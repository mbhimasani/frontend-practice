Create a single-screen app that allows the user to move a “roomba” around a 10x10 grid.

Movement is restricted to two buttons: one to move forward, and one to turn right.

Your representation of the roomba on the grid must indicate the direction that the roomba is currently facing.

The roomba cannot pass through walls; if it hits a wall, it should automatically turn right instead of moving forward.
