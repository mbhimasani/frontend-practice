Prompt: create an image carousel that cycles through images fetched from an [endpoint](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/top/.json?t=all) (displaying a new image every 3 seconds), and allows the user to skip to the next/previous image

Possible extensions:

When the user presses next/previous, make sure that the timer resets

After the last image, make sure the image cycles back to the first

Add image selector circles. The highlighted circle should have the same index of the current image, and the user should be able to click on a circle to jump to that image
